<div id="blog">
  <h1>What is this all about?</h1>
  <p>This is a place where I can share my personal findings, experience and discoveries.</p>
  <p>They may not be new to you, to the world or even to me, but I found them worth sharing, even only if with future me to laugh at.</p>
</div>
<div id='tracking'>
  <h1>Tracking</h1>
  <p>I do not use Google Analytics or other tracking tools here - I used to, but I found myself just not caring enough to look at it from time to time.</p>
  <p>It does not mean I didn't respect your privacy - I strongly believe that anyone <b>really</b> concerned about tracking already has <a href="/tags/#privacy">some countermeasures</a> deployed.</p>
  <p>Also, I do not beleive that not tracking you here will automaticaly disable <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/07/20/20-home-pages-500-trackers-loaded-%E2%80%A8media-succumbs-to-monitoring-frenzy/">all watchful trackers</a> you encounter on almost every site you visit, but it's still nice to have a place where you don't see any third-party trackers in your blocklist.</p>
  <p>I think we should have much more of these around. ;)</p>
  <p>But if you do use something because of a privacy concerns, I think you've already noticied the subject of next part.</p>
</div>
<div id='disqus'>
  <h1><a href='#disqus'>#</a><span> Disqus</span></h1>
  <p>Yes, I do use Disqus for comments.</p>
  <p>It's completely optional and is not required to access all the content - I try to not leave useful additions or updates only in the comments and put them as <i>UPD</i> sections in the posts</p>
  <p>Initially I wanted to either don't provide tools to comment at all or migrate blog later to something powered by <a href="/tags/#rails">RoR</a>, but that would require more maintenance than just plain Jekyll blog.</p>
  <p>And I didn't want to leave you without a place to express what do you think about my posts, so, Disqus to the rescue.</p>
