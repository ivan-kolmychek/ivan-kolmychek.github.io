<div id="blog">
  <h1>What is this all about?</h1>
  <p>This is a place where I can share my personal findings, experience and discoveries.</p>
  <p>They may not be new to you, to the world or even to me, but I found them worth sharing, even if only for future me to laugh at.</p>

<div id='tracking'>
  <h1>Tracking</h1>
  <p>I do not use Google Analytics or other tracking tools here - I used to, but I found myself just not caring enough to look at it from time to time.</p>
  <p>It does not mean I didn't respect your privacy - I strongly believe that anyone <b>really</b> concerned about tracking already has <a href="/tags/#privacy">some countermeasures</a> deployed.</p>
  <p>Also, I do not beleive that not tracking you here will automaticaly disable <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/07/20/20-home-pages-500-trackers-loaded-%E2%80%A8media-succumbs-to-monitoring-frenzy/">all watchful trackers</a> you encounter on almost every site you visit, but it's still nice to have a place where you don't see any third-party trackers in your blocklist.</p>
  <p>I think we should have much more of these around. ;)</p>

<div id='disqus'>
  <h1><a href='#disqus'>#</a><span> Disqus</span></h1>
  <p>Previously I used Disqus for comments, but I've removed it, it wasn't used much.</p>
  <p>If you have any feedback, I would be glad if you <a href="#feedback">send it to me over the mail</a>.</p>
<div id='feedback'>
  <h1><a href="#feedback">#</a><span> I have feedback!</span></h1>
  <p>I would really appreciate if you send any feedback you have to my email, it can be found in the footer on every page except RSS feed.</p>
</div>
