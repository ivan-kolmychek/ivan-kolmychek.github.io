It's been a while since the last post, but I'm still alive and ok.

I've watched my pile of interesting links growing bigger and bigger and, all of a sudden, I was reminded, that I have a blog, which has not seen much activity.

So, let's put it up to a good use.

First change - here comes the [about][about] page! It had to be added at some point.
Maybe it will clear up a purpose for this blog a little bit.

Second - I've got rid of Google Analytics. [Here][about-tracking] are more information about tracking on these pages.

Third - I've added [Disqus][disqus]-powered comments. More details [in the appropriate section of the about page][about-disqus].
Yes-yes, they are completely optional, you can just disable this 3rd party request (or JavaScript entirely - [progressive enhancement][progressive-enhancement] FTW) with your favorite privacy tool and don't be tracked by them. ;)

Stay in touch, I hope that there will be a lot more updates coming.

Good luck and have fun. ;)
