Guys from Yii2 project team have merged my [pull request][pull-request-3164] that resolves issue I've [noted before][issue-3154]. 

So, that's officialy my first accepted contribution to opensource project on Github. There was minor bugfixing in [Tagsistant][tagsistant-site] before, but that was too minor to be a contibution, I think.

It can be just a few lines of code, but for me it's a kind of breakthrough - to be a part of crowd building cool free software.

Feels good. I hope, I'll do it more.
